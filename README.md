# ðŸš€ DevSecOps Automation â€“ End-to-End Solution

This repository is the **umbrella project** for my fully automated, scalable **DevSecOps-GitOps- automation**, designed to demonstrate modern CI/CD, GitOps, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and integrated security practices.  

The solution leverages **Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes (EKS), ArgoCD, Helm, and observability stacks** â€” all organized into modular repositories for reusability and easy maintenance.
